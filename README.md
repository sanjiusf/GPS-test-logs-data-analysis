# GPS-test-logs-data-analysis

The test logs of gateway incoming signal quality check (of GPS data) are analysed in this project to get actionable and valuable insights.
Using python, I have converted the unstructured log files into one single CSV file. After that using Google Big Query and Google Data Studio, I have cleaned the data and visualized it. 

Metadata:
Analysis_of_Gateway_test_data(GPS_data).pdf - Visualization report generated using Google Data Studio
and Data_Cleaning_BigQuery.pdf - Data cleaning report
